function img_out = bfilter2(image1, image2, n, sigma1, sigma2)
%bfilter2 function: perfrom two dimensional bilateral gaussian filtering.
%The standard deviations of the bilateral filter are given by sigma1 and
%sigma2, where the standard deviation of spatial-domain is given by sigma1
% and the standard deviation intensity-domain is given by sigma2.
%This function presents both bilateral filter and joint-bilateral filter.
%If you use the same image as image1 and image2, it is the normal bilateral
%filter; however, if you use different images in image1 and image2, you can
%use it as joint-bilateral filter, where the intensity-domain (range weight)
%calculations are performed using image2 and the spatial-domain (space weight)
%calculations are performed using image1.
%
%Usage:
%   %Example1: normal bilateral filter using 5x5 kernel, spatial-sigma=6, and
%   %intensity-sigma= 0.25:
%   image=bfilter2(I1,I1,5,1.2,0.25);
%   %Example2: joint-bilateral filter using 5x5 kernel, spatial-sigma=1.2,
%   %and range-sigma= 0.25, the spatial-domain calculations are performed
%   %using image (I1) and the intensity-domain calulcations (range weight)
%   %are performed using image (I2):
%   image=bfilter2(I1,I2,5,1.2,0.25);
%   %Example3: use the default values for n, sigma1, and sigma2
%   image=bfilter2(I1);
%
%Input:
%   -image1: the spatial-domain image
%   -image2: the intensity-domain (range weight) image (use the same image
%   for the normal bilateral filter. Use different images for joint-bilateral
%   filter.
%   (default, use the same image; i.e. image2=image1)
%   -n: kernel (window) size [nxn], should be odd number (default=5)
%   -sigma1: the standard deviation of spatial-domain (default=1.2)
%   sigma2: the standard deviation of intensity-domain (default=0.25)
