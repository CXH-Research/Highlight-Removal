% JBFILTER2 Two dimensional Joint bilateral filtering.
%    This function implements 2-D bilateral filtering using
%    the method outlined in, however with weights calculated according
%    to another image.

%       International Conference on Computer Vision, 1998. 
%
%    B = jbfilter2(D,C,W,SIGMA) performs 2-D bilateral filtering
%    for the grayscale or color image A. D should be a double
%    precision matrix of size NxMx1 (i.e., grayscale) 
%    with normalized values in the closed interval [0,1]. 
%    C should be similar to D, from which the weights are 
%    calculated, with normalized values in the closed 
%    interval [0,1].  The half-size of the Gaussian
%    bilateral filter window is defined by W. The standard
%    deviations of the bilateral filter are given by SIGMA,
%    where the spatial-domain standard deviation is given by
%    SIGMA(1) and the intensity-domain standard deviation is
%    given by SIGMA(2).
